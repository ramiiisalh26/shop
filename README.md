# E-Commerce Application â€“ Back-End

## Overview

This project is a fully functional e-commerce back-end application built using Java and the Spring Boot framework. It manages product listings, customer information, order processing, and authentication through RESTful APIs. The project follows best practices in software architecture, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and security.

## Features
- **User Authentication & Authorization:** Implemented using JWT tokens for secure login and user role management.
- **Product Management:** CRUD operations for products, categories, and inventory.
- **Order Processing:** Handles customer orders, payments, and order status tracking.
- **Relational Database Management:** MySQL/PostgreSQL used for persistent data storage, managed with JPA/Hibernate.
- **API Documentation:** Provides endpoints for external interaction using Swagger.
- **Security:** Uses Spring Security to protect sensitive endpoints and implement access control.
- **Payment Integration:** Integrated with third-party payment gateways like PayPal and Stripe.
  
## Technologies Used

- **Java 8+:** The core programming language.
- **Spring Boot:** For building and deploying the back-end services.
- **Spring Security:** For authentication and authorization.
- **JPA (Java Persistence API):** For handling relational database operations.
- **Hibernate:** ORM for database interaction.
- **MySQL/PostgreSQL:** Relational databases for data storage.
- **Swagger:** For API documentation.
- **JUnit:** For unit testing.

## API Endpoints

- **User Authentication:**
